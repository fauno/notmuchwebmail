== Requirements
* Notmuch with python bindings
* An indexed maildir
* Django
* Django-AGPL

== Ideas
* Simple interface, themeable with CSS;
* Text/plain only, for the sake of readability;
* Convert text/html to text/plain formats like newsbeuter pager or vilistextum;
* Threads have their own view;
* Threads shown as a conversation (use diff, think like IM);
* Interface not stuck as an one-page-only website (open views in a new tab, etc.);
* PGP support;
* Attachments have their own view;
* LDAP authentication;
* Each view does only one thing;
